Assignment 1 CS260 LBC

Users can add and take marbles out of a bag, as well as "open" the bag to know how many marbles (and how many of each color) there are in the bag. 

I opted to not use classes (functions?) for this assignments because I am not very confident in my ability to use them correctly.
I just did everything all at once and seperated it with if/else statements. 


Hopefully my updates and everything went through via github.
If not I have also just sent over a "hardcopy" but I think I did it all correctly on here.
