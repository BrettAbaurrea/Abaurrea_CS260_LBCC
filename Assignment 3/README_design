Purpose:
  program creates a queue using user generated input.
  program can also remove items in the queue
  
  
Queue

  Head == start of queue
  Tail == end of queue
  currentItem == current position in the queue
  val == variable for user input

Program: "Enter a value for queue size: "
User: 'enters integer (val)'
Program: for (i = 0; i < val; i++){
             add a digit to the end of the queue, constantly 
             replacing the tail with a new integer to increase 
             the queue length via the end of queue
             "Current Value: Queue[i]"
Program: "Remove how many from queue?"
User: 'enters integer (val)'
Program: for (i = 0; i < val; i++){
              remove a digit from the front of the queue and shift 
              all other data up one in the queue
              "Value Removed: Queue[i]"
              
              [maybe: head->nullptr
                      queue[i] = head
                      tail -> next]
