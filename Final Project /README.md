To follow the graph I used inspiration from my biannual road trip from Corvallis, OR to Sacramento, CA.

The idea for this was starting point of Sacramento, then I chose Redding for my second point on the graph because that's about 2 hours into my drive (or 2 hours left when going the other way), next I went straight into Weed because on the drive because it's one of the last cities before the border, then after Weed I will typically make a pitstop in either Grants Pass or Medford Oregon to get gas and lunch (which is why weed feeds into both of those) lastly, my final stop is Corvallis which is why it is my last section on the graph.

I attempted to kind of implement a shortest path algorithm by using a tutorial from https://www.educative.io/edpresso/how-to-implement-dijkstras-algorithm-in-cpp 
I don't believe I hooked it up correctly to my driver file unfortunately, so the ouput is just basically what we worked on in class.


My graph isn't too complex. It goes from Sacramento (node1) -> Redding (node2) -> Weed (node3) -> Medford (node4)/Grants Pass (node5) -> Corvallis
I was thinking of adding 3 more additional nodes (Salem, Albany, Portland) but decided against it.
